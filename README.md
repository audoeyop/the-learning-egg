**A Machine Learning Model For Training Your AI**
Akaninyene Udoeyop

<small>Machine Learning will play an increasing role in solving some of the worldâ€™s greatest problems. In order to solve these problems, they will need to be mapped into Machine Learning Models.  A Machine Learning Model in Reinforcement Learning is the blueprint that defines the states, actions, rewards, and other elements that are relevant to a learning environment. This includes the logic and policies that guide learning agents to an optimal or nearly optimal solution to a problem. This paper outlines a process for developing Machine Learning Models that is extensible and can be applied to solving problems. This includes a process for implementing a data model using multi-dimensional arrays for efficient data processing. An evaluation of learning policies is also included, assessing their performance compared to manual and automated approaches
